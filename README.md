First-Year-Game
Description: First-Year-Game is a simple web-based game . The code consists of an HTML file (index.html) that loads the p5.js library and a sketch.js script (as seen in the original commit)

The game is built with the p5.js JavaScript library. This is a browser-based game played via opening index.html in a web browser. Using a code editor (Brackets or Phoenix) to run it

The game is a interactive 2D runner where you run across a generative map collects gems as points till you reach the objective.

Setup & Launch Instructions: To use it, one would typically clone/download the repo, ensure the GP7/GP7 folder contents are placed together, and open index.html in a modern web browser. Because p5.js is included locally, no web server is strictly needed (just a browser). Using Brackets or Phoenix code editors (for development)

This game is ran using Brackets editor you can download here https://brackets.io/ or you can use pheonix the newer version https://phcode.io/#/home
